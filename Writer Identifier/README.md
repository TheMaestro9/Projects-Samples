# Writer Identifier 

### Project Description 
this is a pattern recognition project. Given images of paragraphs written by known writeres and an image for an unknown wirter, 
the system should be able to identify the writer of the unknown image. 

the project is an implementation of this paper: [A Set of Novel Features for Writer Identification](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Set-of-Novel-Features-for-Writer-Identification-Hertel-Bunke/a89125e235c0a0f3954f217dc7970a02baa0adb5)

this project is not 100% complete (still working on it) as not all of the features mentioned in the paper are extracted. 

### System Pipeline  
line segmentation -> feature extraction -> classification. 


### Testing 
the project was tested using images from "iam database".
