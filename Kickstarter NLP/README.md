# NLP Kickstarter 
this is an NLP Project from kaggle. the main idea is to build a model that can predict whetehr a project will successed or fail 
depending on its short describtion. 

### Getting Started 
Download the data set from [kaggle Kickstarter](https://www.kaggle.com/oscarvilla/kickstarter-nlp/home) 
then you can basicly run the python file 

### Requirements 
- keras framework.
- tensorflow.
- glove word embeddings.  

### Methodology 
I have used RNN as the model for the classification.
you can learn more about the problem and my solution from the "Kickstarter NLP.pptx" presentation
