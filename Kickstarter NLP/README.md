this is an NLP Project from kaggle. the main idea is to build a model that can predict whetehr a project will successed or fail 
depending on its short describtion. 

I have used RNN as the model for the classification. you can learn more about the problem and my solution from the "Kickstarter NLP.pptx" file 

to run this code you must have keras framework with tensorflow backend installed on you machine. 
you also need to download glove word embeddings.
