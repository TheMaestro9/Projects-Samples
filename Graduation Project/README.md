This was my graduation Project. The Project's main Idea is to detect Speed bumps using mobile phone accelerometer readings.
after the phone captures a sequence of accelerometer values pattern recognition is used to detect if this sequence represent a speed bump.

the code uploaded to this repo is pyhton code that was used to visulaize data captured by accelerometer and try different techniques and models
to get best classification accuracy. The selected model code was then transformed to java to classify the acceleration sequence using the mobile 
application directly. 

The pattern recognition phase pipeline is: 
preprocessing --> Feature extraction --> Classification 

you can run Main.py code it will call all the necessary functions and compare between different models.
